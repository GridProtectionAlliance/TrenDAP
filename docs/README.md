### Trending Data Analytics Platform

![CodeQL](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/TrenDAP/workflows/CodeQL/badge.svg)

The TrenDAP application is being developed under a project with EPRI with a planned Beta release date of October 2021.  

TrenDAP will be an open source, web-based, engineering analytics tool – an analytic workbench – to assist PQ SME’s in conducting ad hoc PQ investigations. 
While TrenDAP will be optimized for display of PQ interval data (e.g., min, max, average data captured periodically), it will be able to display time-series data from multiple sources, such as SCADA data.
